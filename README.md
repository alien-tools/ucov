# UCov

UCov is a proof of concept implementation of syntactic API usage analysis for Java libraries.
It enables developers to better design their software library API as well as understand the usage patterns between their software library and their clients.
UCov parses and analyzes the source code of Java libraries to produce syntactic usage models (SUM) and the source code of Java clients to produce syntactic usage footprints (SUF) and their coverage.
UCov implements a specific API syntactic usage model (SUM) for Java, as follows:

```java
public enum SymbolKind {
    SYMBOL_KIND_TYPE,
    SYMBOL_KIND_CLASS,
    SYMBOL_KIND_INTERFACE,
    SYMBOL_KIND_METHOD,
    SYMBOL_KIND_CONSTRUCTOR,
    SYMBOL_KIND_FIELD
}

public enum SymbolUse {
    SYMBOL_USE_INSTANTIATION, // TYPE_USE, CLASS_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_TYPE_REFERENCE, // TYPE_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_INHERITANCE, // CLASS_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_IMPLEMENTATION, // INTERFACE_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_EXTENSION, // INTERFACE_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_INVOCATION, // METHOD_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_STATIC_INVOCATION, // METHOD_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_OVERRIDING, // METHOD_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_INSTANCE_FIELD_READ, // FIELD_USE
    SYMBOL_USE_INSTANCE_FIELD_WRITE, // FIELD_USE,
    SYMBOL_USE_VIRTUAL_INVOCATION
}
```

UCov outputs a set of report files:

- The API of the Java library (generated by [Roseau](https://github.com/alien-tools/roseau)) exported as a JSON file: ```.API.json```
- The syntactic usage model (SUM) of the Java library (list of all possible uses permitted by the library) exported as a CSV file ```.SUM.csv```
- The syntactic usage footprint (SUF) of a client using the Java library (list of all uses made by the client out of the API) exported as a CSV file ```.SUF.csv```
